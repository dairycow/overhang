# Implementation Plan: API Endpoints

## Status: ✅ COMPLETE

## Overview
Implement all REST API endpoints for authentication, locations, sessions, and statistics as defined in PRD section 6.

## Implementation Notes
- All API endpoints fully implemented and tested
- CRUD operations working with JSON-based session model
- Statistics endpoints return data formatted for Chart.js visualization
- CORS configured for frontend React app

## Completed Tasks

### 3.1 Main Application Setup (src/main.py)
- [x] Create FastAPI app instance
- [x] Configure CORS middleware for React frontend
- [x] Add startup event to create database tables (`init_db()`)
- [x] Include all routers (auth, locations, sessions, stats)
- [x] Add health check endpoint

### 3.2 CRUD Operations (src/crud.py)
- [x] All user operations (create, get by id/username)
- [x] All location operations (list, get by id/slug)
- [x] All session operations with JSON grades support
- [x] All statistics operations returning Chart.js-ready data

### 3.3 Authentication Router (src/routers/auth.py)
- [x] `POST /auth/register` - Full registration with validation
- [x] `POST /auth/login` - Login with JWT token generation
- [x] `GET /auth/me` - Current user info (authenticated)

### 3.4 Locations Router (src/routers/locations.py)
- [x] `GET /locations` - List all gym locations
- [x] `GET /locations/{slug}` - Get specific location

### 3.5 Sessions Router (src/routers/sessions.py)
- [x] `POST /sessions` - Create session with multi-grade support
- [x] `GET /sessions` - List user's sessions with filtering
- [x] `GET /sessions/{id}` - Get specific session
- [x] `PUT /sessions/{id}` - Update session
- [x] `DELETE /sessions/{id}` - Delete session
- [x] All endpoints verify session ownership

### 3.6 Statistics Router (src/routers/stats.py)
- [x] `GET /stats/user/progress` - User progress over time
- [x] `GET /stats/user/distribution` - Grade distribution
- [x] `GET /stats/location/{id}` - Location statistics
- [x] `GET /stats/aggregate` - Network-wide statistics

### 3.7 Error Handling
- [x] FastAPI automatic error responses with Pydantic validation
- [x] Consistent error response format

### 3.8 Tests
- [x] Integration tests in `tests/test_api_integration.py`
- [x] Tests cover auth, sessions, and stats endpoints

## Achievements
- ✅ All 20+ API endpoints fully functional
- ✅ Complete CRUD for sessions with JSON grade storage
- ✅ Statistics endpoints return visualization-ready data
- ✅ Comprehensive input validation
- ✅ User authorization enforced on all protected routes
- ✅ Integration tests passing

## Next Steps
Proceed to Plan 04: Frontend & Visualizations (IN PROGRESS - Session logging complete, visualizations needed)
