  - Different color per location (or uniform blue)
  - Tooltip shows exact count
  - Empty state: "No recent activity"

### 4.4 Location Detail Component
- [x] Create `src/components/LocationDetail.tsx`:
  - Accessible at route `/location/:slug`
  - Location name and details header
  - Aggregate statistics for this location:
    - Total climbs at this location
    - Active climbers count
    - Most popular grade
  - Location grade distribution chart (pie chart)
  - Back to homepage button

#### 4.4.1 Location Distribution Chart
- [x] Create `src/components/charts/LocationDistributionChart.tsx`:
  - Fetch data from `GET /stats/location/{id}`
  - Pie chart showing grade distribution at this location
  - Similar to user distribution but for entire gym
  - Same grade colors and styling
  - Shows aggregate data from all users

### 4.5 Routing Updates
- [x] Update `src/App.tsx` to include:
  - Route `/` → Homepage (public)
  - Route `/login` → Login component
  - Route `/dashboard` → Dashboard component (requires auth)
  - Route `/location/:slug` → LocationDetail component
  - Redirect authenticated users from `/` to `/dashboard`
  - Protect `/dashboard` route (redirect to `/login` if not authenticated)
- [x] Install React Router if not already:
  ```bash
  npm install react-router-dom
  ```

### 4.6 Navigation Component

### 4.8 Type Definitions
- [x] Update `src/types/index.ts` to include:
  - Chart data types
  - Filter state types
  - Statistics response types:
    - `ProgressData`: `{date: string, grade: string}[]`
    - `DistributionData`: `{[grade: string]: number}`
    - `AggregateData`: `{total_climbs: number, by_location: {...}, grade_distribution: {...}}`

### 4.9 Testing & Polish
- [x] Test all charts with real data
- [x] Test empty states (no sessions logged)
- [x] Test filter combinations
- [x] Test on mobile devices
- [x] Verify chart responsiveness
- [x] Check color accessibility
- [x] Ensure charts print properly (if needed)

- [x] Homepage shows network activity bar chart
- [x] Location pages show location-specific pie chart
- [x] All charts use correct gym grade colors
- [x] Filters work and update charts dynamically

## Chart.js Implementation Notes

### Grade Colors (from PRD Section 5)
```typescript
const GRADE_COLORS = {
  'VB': '#3B82F6',   // Blue
  'V0': '#EF4444',   // Red
  'V3': '#A855F7',   // Purple
  'V4-V6': '#1F2937', // Black
  'V6-V8': '#EAB308', // Yellow
  'V7-V10': '#F3F4F6' // White (with dark border)
}
```

### Chart Libraries
- Use `react-chartjs-2` for React bindings
- Import Chart.js components: `Chart`, `Line`, `Pie`, `Bar`
- Register required components in each chart file

### Data Fetching Pattern
```typescript
useEffect(() => {
  const fetchChartData = async () => {
    setLoading(true)
    try {
      const response = await apiClient.get('/stats/...')
      setData(response.data)
    } catch (err) {
      setError('Failed to load chart data')
    } finally {
      setLoading(false)
    }
  }
  fetchChartData()
}, [locationId, startDate, endDate]) // Re-fetch on filter change
```

## Time Estimate
8-10 hours total (completed):
- 2 hours: Chart.js setup + dashboard structure
- 3 hours: Progress chart + distribution chart
- 2 hours: Homepage + network activity chart
- 2 hours: Location detail + location distribution chart
- 1 hour: Routing, navigation, polish

## Dependencies
- Plan 03 (API Endpoints) must be complete ✅
- Backend statistics endpoints working ✅
- React frontend foundation in place ✅

## Additional Features Implemented
Beyond the original plan, the following enhancements were added:
- Aggregate charts for network-wide statistics (AggregateProgressChart, AggregateDistributionChart)
- Advanced dashboard with personal vs aggregate view toggle
- Enhanced filter controls with custom date ranges
- Comprehensive error handling and loading states
- Mobile-first responsive navigation
- Improved empty states with helpful messaging
