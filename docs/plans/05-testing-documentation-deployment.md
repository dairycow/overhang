# Implementation Plan: Testing, Documentation & Deployment

## Status: ðŸ”´ NOT STARTED

## Overview
Complete comprehensive testing, write documentation, and deploy the React SPA + FastAPI application to production.

## Prerequisites
- Plans 01-04 completed âœ… (Plan 04 in progress - visualizations needed)
- Application fully functional locally
- All features implemented

## Architecture Notes
- **Frontend:** React SPA built with Vite, served as static files
- **Backend:** FastAPI serving API + static frontend files
- **Deployment:** Single server, Nginx reverse proxy to FastAPI
- **Build process:** `npm run build` â†’ `dist/` folder served by FastAPI

## Tasks

### 5.1 Comprehensive Testing

#### Backend Testing
- [ ] Achieve 80%+ test coverage:
  - Run `pytest --cov=src --cov-report=html`
  - Identify untested code paths
  - Add tests for uncovered areas
- [ ] Integration tests:
  - Full authentication flow (register â†’ login â†’ protected endpoint)
  - Session CRUD flow
  - Statistics calculation accuracy
  - Filter parameters work correctly
- [ ] Edge case tests:
  - Empty database (no sessions)
  - Invalid date ranges
  - Non-existent location IDs
  - Expired JWT tokens
  - Malformed requests
- [ ] Performance tests:
  - Statistics endpoints with large datasets (simulate 1000+ sessions)
  - Concurrent user sessions

#### Frontend Testing

### 5.3 Frontend Build Integration

#### Serve React Build from FastAPI
- [ ] Update `src/main.py` to serve static files:
  ```python
  from fastapi.staticfiles import StaticFiles

  # Serve React build files
  app.mount("/assets", StaticFiles(directory="../frontend/dist/assets"), name="assets")

  # Catch-all route for React SPA (must be last)
  @app.get("/{full_path:path}")
  async def serve_spa(full_path: str):
      return FileResponse("../frontend/dist/index.html")
  ```
- [ ] Create build script:
  ```bash
  # scripts/build-frontend.sh
  cd packages/frontend
  npm run build
  cd ../..
  ```
- [ ] Update `.gitignore` to exclude `packages/frontend/dist/`
- [ ] Test locally that API routes work and frontend serves correctly

#### Production Build Process
- [ ] Document build steps in deployment guide:
  1. Pull latest code
  2. Build frontend: `cd packages/frontend && npm run build`
  3. Restart FastAPI service
  4. Frontend served from `/`, API at `/api/*` or same origin

### 5.4 Deployment Preparation

#### Environment Configuration
- [ ] Create production `.env` file:
  - Generate secure SECRET_KEY (64+ random characters)
  - Set DATABASE_URL for production SQLite location
  - Set ENVIRONMENT=production
  - Set ALLOWED_ORIGINS=https://overhang.au
  - Set appropriate token expiry
- [ ] Document environment variables in `.env.example`

#### Deployment Scripts
- [ ] Create `scripts/deploy.sh`:
  - Pull latest code
  - Activate virtual environment
  - Install/update dependencies
  - Run any migrations
  - Restart systemd service
  - Test health endpoint
  - Rollback on failure
- [ ] Make script executable
