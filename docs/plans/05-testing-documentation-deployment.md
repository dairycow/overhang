  - License information

### 5.3 Deployment Preparation

#### Environment Configuration
- [ ] Create production `.env` file:
  - Generate secure SECRET_KEY (64+ random characters)
  - Set DATABASE_URL for production SQLite location
  - Set ENVIRONMENT=production
  - Set ALLOWED_ORIGINS=https://overhang.au
  - Set appropriate token expiry
- [ ] Document environment variables in `.env.example`

#### Deployment Scripts
- [ ] Create `scripts/deploy.sh`:
  - Pull latest code
  - Activate virtual environment
  - Install/update dependencies
  - Run any migrations
  - Restart systemd service
  - Test health endpoint
  - Rollback on failure
- [ ] Make script executable

#### Database Migration
- [ ] Seed production database with gym locations:
  - Fhyswick, Canberra
  - Mitchell, Canberra
  - Port Melbourne, Melbourne
  - Marrickville, Sydney
  - Leichhardt, Sydney
- [ ] Verify foreign key constraints
- [ ] Test with sample data

### 5.4 Production Deployment

#### Server Provisioning
- [ ] Provision Ubuntu 22.04 VM:
  - 1GB+ RAM
  - 10GB+ storage
  - Public IP
  - SSH access configured
- [ ] Configure DNS:
  - Point overhang.au to server IP
  - Verify DNS propagation

#### Initial Deployment
- [ ] Follow deployment guide step-by-step
- [ ] Deploy application
- [ ] Configure Nginx and SSL
- [ ] Start services
- [ ] Verify application is accessible at https://overhang.au

#### Smoke Testing
- [ ] Test all critical paths on production:
